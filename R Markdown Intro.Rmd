## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring 
* HTML
* PDF
* MS Word documents. 
For more details on using R Markdown [click here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
